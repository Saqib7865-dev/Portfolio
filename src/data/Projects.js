Admins can create, update, or delete blog posts and manage content via interactive modals that offer a seamless and intuitive experience. break For general users, the platform offers a smooth and engaging interface to read blog posts, navigate between different pages, and submit feedback via a contact form. The UI includes essential pages such as the Home, All Blogs, Contact, FAQs, Privacy Policy, and Login pages. A dedicated section exists for admin-only operations, protected via authentication. break Multer has been integrated for secure and efficient image uploads, enhancing blog post content. Multiple modals are implemented throughout the platform to streamline user interaction, whether it's for content previews, feedback submissions, or admin tasks. break Overall, EduLog serves as a comprehensive and thoughtfully designed blog platform that demonstrates fullstack capabilities, from frontend interaction to backend logic, with an emphasis on both usability and maintainability.",
